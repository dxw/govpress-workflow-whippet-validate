This repo holds a reusable workflow for validating Whippet files in GovPress projects. 

See the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows) for instructions on how to reuse a workflow in another repo, and see the [WordPress template repo](https://github.com/dxw/wordpress-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/whippet.yml) for an example of this workflow in use.
